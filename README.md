# Karhunen_Lo-ve_Decomposition
My Bachelor thesis is in the area of probability theory  and deals with the so called Karhunen-Lo√®ve decomposition of second order stochastic processes. The focus is on a rigorus introduction (via Bochner integration) and optimality of the decomposition wrt. the L2-norm. I provide a new proof for the later.
